# AutoGPT
Auto-GPT functions as an artificial intelligence agent designed to pursue given objectives articulated in natural language. Its operational methodology involves breaking down overarching goals into sub-tasks, utilizing the internet and various tools in an automated loop. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 APIs, Auto-GPT stands out as one of the pioneering applications harnessing GPT-4 for autonomous task execution.

In contrast to interactive systems like ChatGPT, which necessitate explicit manual commands for each task, Auto-GPT distinguishes itself by autonomously assigning new objectives. It operates with the intention of achieving overarching goals, minimizing the obligatory requirement for human input. Proficient in executing responses to prompts to fulfill task objectives, Auto-GPT dynamically formulates and revises its own prompts in recursive instances prompted by incoming information. It adeptly manages both short-term and long-term memory by reading from and writing to databases and files. Additionally, it circumvents limitations on input length imposed by large language models (LLM) through summarization. Auto-GPT autonomously performs internet-based actions, including unattended web searching, web form interactions, and API engagements. Notably, it incorporates text-to-speech functionality for voice output.

Observers highlight Auto-GPT's remarkable capability to generate, debug, test, and edit code. There are even suggestions that this coding proficiency might extend to Auto-GPT's own source code, potentially facilitating self-improvement. However, it's crucial to note that Auto-GPT is restricted in modifying the proprietary GPT models it relies on, and it ordinarily lacks access to its underlying system code.
