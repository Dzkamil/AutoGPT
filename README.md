# AutoGPT
Auto-GPT is an "AI agent" that, given a goal in natural language, will attempt to achieve it by breaking it into sub-tasks and using the internet and other tools in an automatic loop. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 APIs, and is among the first examples of an application using GPT-4 to perform autonomous tasks.

Unlike interactive systems such as ChatGPT, which require manual commands for every task, Auto-GPT assigns itself new objectives to work on with the aim of reaching a greater goal, without a mandatory need for human input. It is able to execute responses to prompts to accomplish a goal task, and in doing so will create and revise its own prompts to recursive instances in response to new information. It manages short-term and long-term memory by writing to and reading from databases and files; manages LLM input length restrictions using summarization; can perform internet-based actions such as web searching, web form, and API interactions unattended; and includes text-to-speech for voice output.

Observers note Auto-GPT's ability to write, debug, test, and edit code, even suggesting this ability may extend to Auto-GPT's own source code, enabling self-improvement. However, as the underlying GPT models it uses are proprietary, Auto-GPT cannot modify them, and it does not ordinarily have access to its own base system code.
